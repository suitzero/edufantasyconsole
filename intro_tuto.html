Now we are going to test how display works in our fantasy console. 
Try following function

fill_rect(0,0,256,256,153,217,234)

our console display size is 256x256, which means we are going to fill the 256x256 grid to show something.

we put following information(parameters) to the function to draw something on the screen.

fill_rect(starting column number,starting row number,width,height,green,blue,red)

red,green,blue is 0~255 number that are added together in various ways to make another color
